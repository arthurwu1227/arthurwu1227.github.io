I improved the speed of data processing within my research team by over 50% by leveraging parallel execution through Python\u0026rsquo;s Dask library. I was listed as the first author on a research paper that was published in George Mason University\u0026rsquo;s student science journal.\nProgramming Intern, George Washington University November 2021 - May 2023 I worked under two separate mentors during my time at George Washington University. Under graduate student Vitaliy Novik, I wrote browser automation scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium which collected 2000+ entries of online review data. I was later mentioned on a research paper that was presented to the Southern Economic Association 92nd annual conference. Under Dr. Jenny Zha Giedt of the GWU Department of Accounting, I developed a Python program which enabled economists to easily collect up to 2GB+ of FINRA short sale volume data, allowing GWU\u0026rsquo;s Department of Accounting to collect 650x more entries of historical short sale volume data.\n","date":"1 January, 0001","id":1,"permalink":"/experience/","summary":"Digital Platforms Intern, Allianz Partners June 2024 - August 2024 Python-based financial software development.\nInformation Systems Research Intern, George Mason University June 2022 - August 2022 During my summer as an Information Systems Intern at George Mason University through the ASSIP program, I built a predictive model that leveraged 100GB+ of public financial data which predicted health outcomes in 3000+ US counties.
