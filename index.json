I improved the speed of data processing within my research team by over 50% by leveraging parallel execution through Python\u0026rsquo;s Dask library.

Under graduate student Vitaliy Novik, I wrote browser automation scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium which collected 2000+ entries of online review data. I was later mentioned on a research paper that was presented to the Southern Economic Association 92nd annual conference. Under Dr. Jenny Zha Giedt of the GWU Department of Accounting, I developed a Python program which enabled economists to easily collect up to 2GB+ of FINRA short sale volume data, allowing GWU\u0026rsquo;s Department of Accounting to collect 650x more entries of historical short sale volume data.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
