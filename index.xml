I improved the speed of data processing within my research team by over 50% by leveraging parallel execution through Python&amp;rsquo;s Dask library. I was listed as the first author on a research paper that was published in George Mason University&amp;rsquo;s student science journal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-intern-george-washington-university&#34;&gt;Programming Intern, George Washington University&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;november-2021---may-2023&#34;&gt;November 2021 - May 2023&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I worked under two separate mentors during my time at George Washington University. Under graduate student Vitaliy Novik, I wrote browser automation scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium which collected 2000+ entries of online review data. I was later mentioned on a research paper that was presented to the Southern Economic Association 92nd annual conference. Under Dr. Jenny Zha Giedt of the GWU Department of Accounting, I developed a Python program which enabled economists to easily collect up to 2GB+ of FINRA short sale volume data, allowing GWU&amp;rsquo;s Department of Accounting to collect 650x more entries of historical short sale volume data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HooRides is a carpooling app that was developed with the University of Virginia community in mind. Built with React Native and Firebase, HooRides is a cross-platform application that facilitates rides for UVA students and faculty to and from Charlottesville. So far, 1000+ km of rides have been scheduled using HooRides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

I executed BeautifulSoup and Selenium scripts to assist in data collection needs, collecting megabytes of unit-level review data. A final research paper was presented by my research mentor at the Southern Economic Association 2022 Annual Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;drawing-insights-on-large-health-contract-datasets-using-statistical-learning-and-parallel-computinghttpsjournalsgmueduindexphpjssrarticleview3399&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.gmu.edu/index.php/jssr/article/view/3399&#34;&gt;Drawing Insights on Large Health Contract Datasets Using Statistical Learning and Parallel Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my internship at George Mason University, I applied parallel computing with Python&amp;rsquo;s Dask library to analyze large government contract datasets. I used multivariate panel regression to explore the impact of government health contracts on public health outcomes. My contributions were recognized in a co-authored paper published in the university&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate science journal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spearheaded the development of a customer support chatbot for Babylon Micro-Farms with React.js and the OpenAI Assistants API. I led a team of 4 software engineers using Agile project management methodology, achieving project competion ahead of schedule and delivering a polished web application to Babylon Micro-Farms which improved the efficiency of their account management and customer support teams. Later, I presented the chatbot application to the Babylon Micro-Farms CTO and Head of Data Science, fostering a continued shift in their customer support strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m part of a team of 20+ engineers at a University of Virginia-funded nonprofit which develops an academic planning web application called theCourseForum. I helped revamp the user authentication page by implementing responsive authentication to expedite login, benefitting 41,000+ users with significant time savings. I also worked with CI tools such as GitHub Actions to ensure successful application deployment for over 41,000 users alongside an actively growing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
