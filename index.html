Hello fellow antiracist activists.
<br> I am sure you are aware of the terrible actions against our minority brothers and sisters
<br> insinuated by the systemically racist white nationalist undertone of this nation we all share.
<br> minorities are denied adequate healthcare, jobs, and living standards
<br> one example of this white supremacy in action is the fact that the school cafeteria serves only the whiteist chips known to man, which are not spicy at all and are an embarassment to all palletes' except that of the white man's.
<br> Here are some resources to help our minority brothers and sisters:
