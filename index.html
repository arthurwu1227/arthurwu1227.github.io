Dear Potential Employers, I am not racist.
	There is no reason you must worry about my political opinions when employing me.
	I am not a political extremist. I am in fact a registered member of the Independent Party.
	Furthermore I do not have 23 charges of violations of title VII as my time as leader of my school's Economics Club, despite what my detractors may say.
	Please hire me.
	
	Yours truly,
	Arthur Wu
